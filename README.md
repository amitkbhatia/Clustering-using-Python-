Application of clustering (recommendation engines, market segmentation, image detection, anomaly detection, )

Unsupervised learning uncovers hidden structure from unlabeled data.  It encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. One example could be to classify customer based on their purchase.

Clustering and its application - Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. Clustering has application in recommendation engines, market segmentation, image segmentation, anomaly detection and many more areas
